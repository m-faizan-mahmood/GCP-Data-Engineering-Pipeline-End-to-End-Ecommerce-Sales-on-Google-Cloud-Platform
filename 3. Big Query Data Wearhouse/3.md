Phase 3: Data Warehouse â€“ BigQuery Integration
Once data is staged in Google Cloud Storage, it is ingested into Google BigQuery, a fully managed and serverless enterprise-grade data warehouse. The ingestion process supports both federated querying and batch loading, enabling seamless integration of structured data into relational schemas optimized for analytics.
Transformation & Data Cleaning Workflow:
Date Normalization: Standardizes date and timestamp fields to ensure consistency across all records.


Null Handling & Outlier Treatment: Implements rule-based imputations and anomaly detection for improved data quality.


Data Type Enforcement: Casts each attribute to its appropriate data type for schema consistency.


Relational Integrity: Enforces referential integrity using SQL-based joins and constraint logic to establish relationships across primary and foreign keys.


Deduplication: Ensures idempotent ingestion by applying hash-based uniqueness checks where applicable.


Why BigQuery?
BigQuery was selected due to its ability to execute ultra-fast analytical queries on massive datasets without the need for infrastructure management. Its distributed architecture, built-in ML capabilities, and native GCS integration make it ideal for handling high-throughput ETL and business intelligence workloads.
At this stage, the pipeline transitions from the raw data lake (GCS) to a structured, query-optimized data warehouse (BigQuery), supporting advanced analytics, dashboarding, and downstream ML applications.
