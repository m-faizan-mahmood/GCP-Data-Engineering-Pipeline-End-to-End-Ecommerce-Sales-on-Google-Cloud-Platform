Phase 2: Cloud Storage – Data Lake Layer
Following the ingestion phase, the structured datasets—serialized in CSV and JSON formats—are programmatically uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). This layer functions as the raw data lake, providing a centralized, immutable, and highly durable repository for batch-ingested files. Each file is stored using a logical directory structure partitioned by entity type and timestamp to support efficient downstream retrieval.
Purpose: Serves as the staging zone in the Lakehouse architecture, enabling schema-on-read access for transformation and analysis pipelines.


Advantages:
Horizontally scalable and cost-optimized storage tier


Native integration with BigQuery and other GCP services


High availability, data lifecycle management, and fine-grained IAM-based security controls


Enables parallel processing and flexible schema evolution
